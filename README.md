# Clock

This is a simple clock made with [streamlit](https://streamlit.io). \
It serves as an example, to show off, what is possible to build with streamlit. \
The user interface is not beautiful, but gets the job done. \
The clock displays time in UNIX (Base10 and binary formatted) and local time (What one usually reads off their clock).

> [!NOTE]
> Time might be off by 0.5 seconds or less, due to the script rerunning only every 0.5 seconds.
